# Projects

**[Tic Tac Toe]**

This is web game app built with React js and Redux. I initially created an earlier tic tac toe app which used solely Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This time around, I decided to do a remake it with my newly discovered React and Redux knowledge. I used the minimax algorithm to implement the AI character in the game. There are two different modes, insane and normal. You can play as either X's or O's. [View on Github](https://github.com/BrianDeJesus/ticTacToe)

**[Binary Helper]**

I built this app to help me with my Physics 301 class (digital circuits) at CSUSM. This app was also built with React but not Redux because the app itself didn't need too much state managing. I knew we would be dealing with binary numbers alot so I decided to do it. Something I could improve on is to add a feature where the user could convert from any base number system to any other base number system. I didn't have the time to go and implement that during school because the class was heavy but I look forward to maybe creating a new app for that purpose.

**[Temperature Sensor]**

This Arduino project was made to let me check the temperature wherever I took it. [View on Github](https://github.com/BrianDeJesus/Temperature-Sensor)
