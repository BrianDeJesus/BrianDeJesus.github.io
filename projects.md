# Projects

*These and more can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/BrianDeJesus).*

**[Tic Tac Toe]**

This is a web game app built with React js and Redux. I initially created an earlier tic tac toe app which used solely Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This time around, I decided to do a remake with my newly discovered React and Redux knowledge. I used the [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to implement the AI character in the game. There are two different modes; insane and normal. You can play as either X's or O's.

**[News Aggregator]**

This desktop app was written in C++ with the [QT](https://www.qt.io/) Framework and I collaborated on it with my Software Engineering group at CSUSM. It has many features which include fetching news, filtering the news, setting perferred news sources and many more. We used a Singleton design pattern. This was my most recent project and was the funnest to work on. I learned a lot from it.

**[Binary Helper]**

I built this app as a tool to help me with my Physics 301 class (digital circuits) at CSUSM. This app was also built with React but not Redux because the app itself didn't need too much state managing. I knew we would be dealing with binary numbers alot so I decided to do it. Something I could improve on is to add a feature where the user could convert from any base number system to any other base number system. I didn't have the time to go and implement that during school because the class was heavy but I look forward to maybe creating a new app for that purpose.

**[Virtual Reality History Museum]**

This game was built using the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) platform with C#. It was a project for my Game programming class at CSUSM. The game has 4 main levels. More info can be found on the game's [wiki page](https://github.com/CodingMorry7/VRHistoryMuseum/wiki). I was in charge of creating the Egyptian Level design which had pyramids and mummies that spawn to chase you around the map. In my level, the user held a sword used for killing the enemy mummies. This project was the highlight of that semester. [View on Github](https://github.com/CodingMorry7/VRHistoryMuseum)

**[Temperature Sensor]**

This [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) project was made to let me check the temperature in my room since it was always different than everywhere else for some reason. [View on Github](https://github.com/BrianDeJesus/Temperature-Sensor)
