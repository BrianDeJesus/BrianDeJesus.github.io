# About me

**Education**

I'm currently a Computer Science student at California State University, San Marcos(*Cal State Stair Master*). I will be graduating in the Spring of 2018. 

**Hobbies**

I love doing fun things. I like to surf usually in the mornings. I like coding. I play guitar once every now and then. If I'm not in front of a computer coding, you can usually find me at the beach. 

**Work Experience**

I've been working as a math lab tutor in the math lab at my school for 3 years. I enjoy this job. We offer free walk in tutoring for fellow students. We assist, guide, and motivate fellow students who are taking classes which range from algebra to calculus 2.
